Set to Yes, at the end of normal drive detection, COM ports 1-7 (in reverse order) will be scanned for a connection to a serial drive server. This option provides flexibility with the COM port and baud rate to be used, it need not be configured ahead of time, but at the expense of a slower boot process. Even when this option is set to No, this functionality can still be invoked by holding down the ALT key at the end of normal drive detection. Note that if any serial drives are detected during the normal drive detection, no scan will take place (to avoid finding the same drive twice).
